## Introduction
 My name is Divine Mutoni, I am a second year MURP with a Design and Development Concertration. My elevator pitch is that I make up for my limited coding skills with an epic vibe haha. I enjoy learning and spatial mapping with python coding is my big challenge for this quarter.
 In terms of personal interests, I would like to work in the climate finance and/or climate advocacy space post-graduation, and by extension would find material in the space helpful. More specifically, I would be interested in working with data on environmental disaster tracking metrics (heat mapping, flood prediction etc), forest economy, landfill waste emissions. 
 I have some knowledge with R but otherwise no prior experience with python; looking forward to learning from all of you
